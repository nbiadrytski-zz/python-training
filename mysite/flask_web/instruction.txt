To use virtual env:

1. Create mysite folder on project level
2. Inside mysite folder create folder (e.g. flask_web) with your app
3. On Mac OS run: virtualenv venv
These command creates a venv/ directory in your project where all dependencies are installed
4. Then activate your virtual env by running:
source venv/bin/activate
You should see a (venv) appear at the beginning of your terminal prompt indicating that you are working inside the virtualenv.
5. If you need any library, you can install it now, e.g.: pip3 install flask.
It will get installed in the venv/ folder, and not conflict with other projects.
6. Now you can run your app from your virtual env, e.g.:
pyhton3 flask_web/demo.py
7. To leave the virtual environment run:
deactivate
