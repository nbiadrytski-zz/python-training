# Considered by pytest as a “local plugin” and can contain hook functions and fixtures.
# Hook functions are a way to insert code into part of the pytest execution process to alter how pytest works.
# Fixtures are setup and teardown functions that run before and after test functions,
# and can be used to represent resources and data used by the tests.
# Hook functions and fixtures that are used by tests in multiple subdirectories should be in tests/conftest.py.
# You can have multiple conftest.py files;
# for example, you can have one at tests and one for each subdirectory under tests.
